COMMIT 1*: Modify style to align with Tidyverse where I missed instances of this:

- plot code (e.g. lines 237-242)

- indentation in:
  - Lines 305-309
  - Lines 382-387
  - Lines 403-409
  - Lines 447-452

- Fix variable names where applicable
(e.g. pop_data, population_data -> pop_data)

- Omit r code output where not needed 
(specifically in instances when I generate histograms)


COMMIT 2*: Add comments and alter explanations to improve file (especially knitted) readability:

- Bracketed notes describing the purpose of each cell don't show on knitted files (oops).
I need to add comments mirroring or slightly elaborating on the bracketed notes so that they can be read in html.

- elaborate on questions if/when they ask for specific time periods

- more code commenting on other blocks, where appropriate
(e.g. plot code)

- out-of-block descriptions of blocks when more convenient or applicable than within-block comments.


COMMIT 3*: Modify Visuals and add code


*Note that this is the plan; additional commits may be required.
Additionally, each of these commits take place after the base 2 required to set up the repository.
So these are more like commits 3,4,5, than 1,2,3.

- I can modify the ASFR/ASDR histograms to include overlapping data for easier comparison.

- I can change axes (notably the x-axis) to be more readable on said histograms.

- I can figure out how to insert r code into discussions when appropriate.
