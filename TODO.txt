COMMIT 1*: Modify style to align with Tidyverse where I missed instances of this:
COMPLETED

- plot code (e.g. lines** 237-242)

- indentation in:
  - Lines 305-309
  - Lines 382-387
  - Lines 403-409
  - Lines 447-452

- Fix variable names where applicable
(e.g. pop_data, population_data -> pop_data)

- Omit r code output where not needed 
(specifically in instances when I generate histograms)


COMMIT 2*: Add comments and alter explanations to improve file (especially knitted) readability:
PARTLY COMPLETED (more comments and out-of-block descriptions)

- Bracketed notes describing the purpose of each cell don't show on knitted files (oops).
I need to add comments mirroring or slightly elaborating on the bracketed notes so that they can be read in html.

- elaborate on questions if/when they ask for specific time periods

- more code commenting on other blocks, where appropriate
(e.g. plot code)

- out-of-block descriptions of blocks when more convenient or applicable than within-block comments.


COMMIT 3*: Modify Visuals and add code


*NOTE 1: that this is the plan; additional commits may be required.
Additionally, each of these commits take place after the base 2 required to set up the repository.
So these are more like commits 3,4,5, than 1,2,3.

- I can modify the ASFR/ASDR histograms to include overlapping data for easier comparison.
  - Although Q5 (for the ASDR plots) only calls for calculation of ASDR in the 2005-10 period,
    I think that the question can only be properly answered if we compare our results to the
    initial 50s period, so I am keeping both periods.

- I can change axes (notably the x-axis) to be more readable on said histograms.

- I can figure out how to insert r code into discussions when appropriate.

- Update HTML printout, as I have altered the graphs at this point


**NOTE 2: My peer reviewer must have been using a different text editor than qmd,
as the lines mentioned in the review do not add up with the lines on my editor
(e.g. at one point, lines 447-452 are mentioned, but my code only seems to go up to 351).
I will do the best I can with the revisions, regardless.
