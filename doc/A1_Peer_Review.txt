	Peer Review Feedback – Assignment 1

I really like the visuals that you added to certain problems, as well as the informative discussions about the results. 
These made the report much easier to understand! The folders were also well organized which made the project as a whole easier to explore. 
Here are some areas you could adjust to make the report easier to read and follow. 

- Even though you give a “blueprint” on lines 102-123 for what each block in a question achieves, it would have been helpful to have the specific description above each block as well. 
  When reading this in a knitted format, it’s difficult to follow what’s going on for the code in each problem. 
  I think it would help the flow a lot to walk the reader through each solution.
 
- I would suggest not outputting the raw numbers for situations where you provide an easier-to-interpret visual anyways, such as when you compare ASFR on lines 225-229.

- I really like the histograms you provide in Problems 2 and 5! 
  It would be a cool enhancement to have the Kenya and Sweden histograms overlap so we can directly compare them. 
  - Additionally, it would be good to have some code commenting for the plots. 
  - I also noticed that the plot code on lines 237-242 does not follow tidyverse style. 
    Make sure to include spaces after commas and maybe break up the long line of code, while following appropriate code indentation. 

- There are a few places where the code does not have tidyverse style indentation: 
  - Lines 305-309
  - Lines 382-387 (also needs spacing between operators)
  - Lines 403-409 (break up long lines of code, also needs spacing after commas)
  - Lines 447-452

- This isn’t necessary, but I would suggest inserting r code in your discussions that refer directly to the values that you discuss. 
For example, in Discussion #3, you could refer to birth rates directly by creating a variable from the code in lines 305-309 and call that directly in the discussion section. 

- This is small, but in some functions you create the argument is called “pop_data” (e.g., line 207) and in others it’s called “population_data” (e.g., lines 282, 338). 
It might be nice to have them be consistent across all functions. 

- Your answer for Question 5 does not seem to be specific to the period of 2005-2010, which is what the question is asking for. 
It looks like maybe the histograms are split by time period, but it is not clearly labeled. 
It is also not clear for Question 6 whether the answer is specific to the 2005-2010 range. 

- The variable “popP” created in a function on line 450 should have a tidyverse style name, such as pop_prop.

- There are some places where more code commenting would be helpful. 
While you noted that you don’t want to overcomment the code, I think some additional comments could be helpful, especially for the functions. 
For example, it might be helpful to note that the function starting on line 282 will compute TFR for each time period. 


I really appreciate the informative discussion pieces at the end of each question. It helps tie the results for each analysis together. Great job!
